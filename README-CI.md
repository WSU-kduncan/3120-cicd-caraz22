## CI Project Overview
### The goal of this project is to use Docker to create a container image and control it using DockerHub and GitHub actions.

* To install Docker, you first need to download a couple of things. There is a [great guide online](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10) with download links for multiple versions of WSL 2. The site also has a download link for Ubuntu 20.04. After that, you should be able to open up Ubuntu on a terminal. Now you can finally install Docker! The command that you need to use is as follows: `sudo apt install docker.io`
